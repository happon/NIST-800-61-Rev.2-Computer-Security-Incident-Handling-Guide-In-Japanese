# Appendex B Incident-Related Data Element

Organizations should identify a standard set of incident-related data elements to be collected for each incident.  


This effort will not only facilitate more effective and consistent incident handling, but also assist the organization in meeting applicable incident reporting requirements. The organization should designate a set of basic elements (e.g., incident reporter’s name, phone number, and location) to be collected when the incident is reported and an additional set of elements to be collected by the incident handlers during their response.  


The two sets of elements would be the basis for the incident reporting database, previously discussed in Section 3.2.5.  


The lists below provide suggestions of what information to collect for incidents and are not intended to be comprehensive.  


Each organization should create its own list of elements based on several factors, including its incident response team model and structure and its definition of the term “incident.”  


B.1 Basic Data Elements  


 Contact Information for the Incident Reporter and Handler  
 – Name  
 – Role  
 – Organizational unit (e.g., agency, department, division, team) and affiliation  
 – Email address  
 – Phone number  
 – Location (e.g., mailing address, office room number)  


 Incident Details  
 – Status change date/timestamps (including time zone): when the incident started, when the incident was discovered/detected, when the incident was reported, when the incident was resolved/ended, etc.  
 – Physical location of the incident (e.g., city, state)  
 – Current status of the incident (e.g., ongoing attack)  
 – Source/cause of the incident (if known), including hostnames and IP addresses  
 – Description of the incident (e.g., how it was detected, what occurred)  
 – Description of affected resources (e.g., networks, hosts, applications, data), including systems’ hostnames, IP addresses, and function  
 – If known, incident category, vectors of attack associated with the incident, and indicators related to the incident (traffic patterns, registry keys, etc.)  
 – Prioritization factors (functional impact, information impact, recoverability, etc.)  
 – Mitigating factors (e.g., stolen laptop containing sensitive data was using full disk encryption)  
 – Response actions performed (e.g., shut off host, disconnected host from network)  
 – Other organizations contacted (e.g., software vendor)  
 
 General Comments  


B.2 Incident Handler Data Elements  

 Current Status of the Incident Response  

 Summary of the Incident  

 Incident Handling Actions  
 – Log of actions taken by all handlers  
 – Contact information for all involved parties  
 – List of evidence gathered  

 Incident Handler Comments  
 Cause of the Incident (e.g., misconfigured application, unpatched host)  
 Cost of the Incident  
 Business Impact of the Incident49
